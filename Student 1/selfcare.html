        <h2>About Self Care</h2>
        <p>Self-care encompasses a range of practices and activities aimed at promoting well-being and maintaining balance in one's life. It involves taking deliberate actions to address your physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual needs. Self-care is not selfish; rather, it's a fundamental aspect of healthy living that enables individuals to recharge, reduce stress, and cultivate resilience. Examples of self-care activities include exercise, meditation, journaling, spending time with loved ones, pursuing hobbies, setting boundaries, seeking therapy or counseling when needed, and engaging in activities that bring joy and fulfillment. Prioritizing self-care is essential for overall health and happiness, allowing individuals to better cope with life's challenges and thrive in their daily lives.</p>

      <h2>Type of self care</h2>
      <p> “It could be anything that floats your boat — anything that puts a smile on your face,” Dr. Gill Lopez says. “Anything that makes you feel cared for, even if it’s you caring for yourself.”

        <h3>There are a few different categories of self-care:</h3>
        
        <h3>Emotional self-care</h3>
        <p>such as self-talk, weekly bubble baths, saying “no” to things that cause unnecessary stress, giving yourself permission to take a pause, or setting up a weekly coffee date with a friend</p>
        <h3>Physical self-care</h3>
        <p>psuch as prioritizing sleep, adopting an exercise routine you can stick with, or choosing healthy and nourishing foods over highly processed ones</p>
        <h3>Spiritual self-care</h3>
        <p>such as attending a religious service, spending time in nature, meditating, incorporating regular acts of kindness into your day, or keeping a gratitude journal</p>

          <h2>What Counts as Self-Care, and What Does not</h2>
          <p>
            Self-care encompasses activities and practices that prioritize one's physical, mental, and emotional well-being, tailored to individual needs and preferences. It involves engaging in activities that promote wellness, setting boundaries to prevent burnout, seeking support when needed, managing stress effectively, and avoiding harmful behaviors. True self-care entails nurturing oneself through positive actions while recognizing and avoiding behaviors that neglect or undermine one's overall health and happiness.</p>
