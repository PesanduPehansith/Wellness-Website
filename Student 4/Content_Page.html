                <p> Mental health encompasses our emotional, psychological, and social well-being, influencing our thoughts, feelings, and actions. It plays a crucial role in how we manage stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Throughout life, from childhood to adulthood, mental health is vital. It enables individuals to cope with life's challenges, realize their potential, learn effectively, work productively, and contribute to their communities. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health goes beyond the absence of mental disorders; it involves actively managing conditions and maintaining overall wellness and happiness. Mental illness, on the other hand, refers to a range of conditions that can affect a person's thinking, perceptions, mood, or behavior, making it challenging to handle work, relationships, and other daily demands. </p>
